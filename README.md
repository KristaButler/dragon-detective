# Dragon Detective

# Version 1.0

This is a game based on a family favorite from when I was growing up - Slueth (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/594/sleuth).

1.0 Constitues the first draft of the game. A bit of a proof of concept for myself and a chance to practice my React skills.
I have many improvements planned for the future, including a version where you can play with friends and maybe even a mobile app version.
