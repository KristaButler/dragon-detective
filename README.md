# Dragon Detective

# Version 2.0

After having a few beta testers and myself play through several games I wanted to make some improvements.
I also felt Redux was a bit clunky and overkill for this small app. So I refactored to use zustand instead.
I also refactored the components and streamlined them.

New Features:
Home page
Game Settings including Avatar customization
New game play layout and controls
Notes and Auto Notes feature.
